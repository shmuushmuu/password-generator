## Description of Project
We were tasked with creating a password generator in JavaScript. The HTML doc and CSS stylesheet were already done for us. The generator required input from the user: how many characters would you like? Would you like to use lower case letters? Upper case letters? Special characters? Numbers?

I rather enjoyed this project. I like problem solving... moreso other people's problems than my own, but that's a debugging joy opportunity for another day.

Password: sw0RDf15h.
It's always swordfish.

## Visuals
The website should look like this when a correct password is generated (with DevTools open)

This is the way it will look if the user makes an error.
